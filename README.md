# Github releases order issue

A repo reproducing the Github releases order issue.

There's [a few tags][tags] created for this repo,
and here's the order of their creation (oldest to newest):

* v0.1.0
* v0.2.0
* v1.0.0
* v1.0.1
* v0.2.1
* v1.1.0

As you can see [in the tags][tags] (or [releases][releases]),
they are displayed in the correct semver order, so the issue hasn't been reproduced.
