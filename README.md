# Github releases order issue

A repo reproducing the Github releases order issue.

There's [a few tags][tags] created for this repo,
and here's the order of their creation (oldest to newest):

* July 16th
  * v0.1.0
  * v0.2.0
  * v1.0.0
  * v1.0.1
  * v0.2.1
  * v1.1.0
* July 17th
  * v1.2.0
  * v1.2.1
  * v0.2.2

As you can see [in the tags][tags] (or [releases][releases]),
same-day items are displayed in the correct semver order, but this order is broken for items created on different days.
