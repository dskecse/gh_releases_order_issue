# Github releases order issue

A repo reproducing the Github releases order issue

There's [a few tags](https://github.com/dskecse/gh_releases_order_issue/tags) created for this repo,
and here's the order of their creation:

* v0.1.0
* v0.2.0
* v1.0.0
* v1.0.1
* v0.2.1
* v1.1.0

As you can see in the tags, they are displayed in the correct semver order, so the issue hasn't been reproduced.
